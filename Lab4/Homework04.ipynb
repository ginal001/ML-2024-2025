    "# **Homework Assignment: Analyzing and Plotting Bias in Penalized Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will explore how **Ridge** and **Lasso** regression introduce **bias** into a model to reduce **variance**, and how the choice of the regularization parameter $\\lambda$ affects this trade-off. The goal is to visualize and analyze the **bias-variance trade-off** and understand the conditions under which penalization helps or hinders model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **The Question**\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does varying the regularization parameter $\\lambda$ in Ridge and Lasso regression impact the trade-off between bias and variance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate a synthetic dataset based on a **known** linear relationship:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\ldots + \\epsilon\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  where $$\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "  use a **high-dimensional** setting (e.g., 50 predictors) with only a few non-zero true coefficients to emphasize the effects of regularization. I stress, the $\\beta_i$ coefficients should be known for this experiment and they should be mostly 0, with only a few non-zero parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Investigate how increasing $\\lambda$ influences the model’s **bias**, **variance**, and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.\n",
    "- Plot **Bias²**, **Variance**, and **MSE** on a single graph for both Ridge and Lasso models.\n",
    "- Explain MSE decomposition into bias and variance. Read more on the MSE decomposition if you need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Does the regularization lead to an optimal trade-off point where MSE is minimized? Explain why this point exists.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:**\n",
    " - As $\\lambda$ increases:\n",
    "   - **Bias** increases (the model becomes too simple).\n",
    "   - **Variance** decreases (the model becomes more stable).\n",
    "   - **MSE** forms a **U-shape**, revealing the optimal trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze how **Ridge** and **Lasso** differ in terms of their bias-variance trade-offs.\n",
    "- Discuss situations where one method may outperform the other, considering factors like **feature sparsity** and **multicollinearity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Colab Notebook Requirements**\n",
    "- Your **Colab notebook** should:\n",
    "  - Simulate the synthetic dataset and apply Ridge and Lasso regression.\n",
    "  - Plot **Bias²**, **Variance**, and **MSE** against $\\lambda$ for both models.\n",
    "  - Include a section answering the questions.\n",
    "  - Be well-documented with comments and explanations for each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Publish on GitHub**\n",
    "- Upload your Colab notebook to your **GitHub repository** for this course.\n",
    "- In your repository’s **README**, include a **link** to the notebook.\n",
    "- In the notebook include **“Open in Colab”** badge so the notebook can be launched directly from GitHub."
